Attraction (Chapter 10 - 2)

Propinquity
	1. Studies of Propinquity and Attraction
		- Westgate West Study (Festinger, Schacter, & Black, 1950):
			- Used a sociometric survey that attempts to measure the interpersonal relationships in a group of people.
			- Measured functional distance - an architectural layout's propensity to encourage or inhibit certain activities, like contact between people.
			* Think of apartment layout - more likely to interact with people in apartments close to you.
			* Alphabet and attraction are correlated: people with similar starting names are closer..?
	2. Explanations of Propinquity
		a. Availability and Propinquity
			- If you are to become friends, you must establish contact with another person.
		b. Anticipating Interaction
			- People tend to interact with those whom you expect to meet
		c. The Mere Exposure Effect
			- Long term presence makes people like them
			- The more often people are exposed to something, whether it be a fruit, vegetable, or Canadian city, the more they tend to like it.
			* Robert Zajonc and Chinese Pictographs. Showed certain ones much more frequently than others, and subjects tended to like the common symbols most.
			* Rats were raised listening to either Mozart or Schoenberg, and when placed in a cage with one side playing Mozart and one side playing Schoenberg, the rats tended to prefer the side of music that they were raised on.
Similarity and Attraction
	1. Studies of Similarity and Attraction
		- Whyte (1956) study of Chicago suburb layout
		- Newcomb (1956, 1961)
		- "Bogus Stranger" paradigm
	2. Don't Opposites Attract? Complementarity
		- Most studies claiming to support complementarities have been criticized on methodological grounds
		- Similarity appears to be the rule, and complementarities, the exception, in attraction.
	3. Why Does Similarity Promote Attraction?
		a. Similar others validate our beliefs and orientations
			- People who share our beliefs, opinions, attitudes, preferences validate yours, which reinforces your ideas rather than challenge them.
 		b. Similarity facilitates smooth interactions
 			- Similar others make you feel comfortable and further facilitate your interactions
 		c. We expect similar other to like us
 			- We are quite narcissistic
 		d. Similar others have qualities we like
Physical Attractiveness
	- Evolutionary Explanations
	- Cultural Explanations
	1. Impact of Physical Attractiveness
		a. Halo Effect: a cognitive bias whereby the perception of a particular trait is influenced by the perception of the other traits in a sequence of interpretations (e.g. attractive person must be a good person)
		>>> The physical attractiveness stereotype may be due to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the tendency for people to act in ways that elicit confirmation of a belief that they hold.
		b. Early Effects of Physical Attractiveness
		c. Gender and the Impact of Physical Attractiveness
	2. Why Does Physical Attractiveness Have Such Impact?
		a. Immediacy
		b. Prestige (Sigall and Landy (1973) study)

		|                | Confident       | Less Confident  |

		* Subjects saw a girl confederate come in to the test area, thinking she's just another student. The girl is either dolled up to look attractive or made to appear unattractive. Other tester mentions she is his girlfriend or just another student, and subject was later asked to rate the tester

		What Kinds of Faces/Bodies are Perceived as Attractive? Evolutionary Explanations
			- Complexion: Skin that looks free of blemishes, blotches, sores, and rashes is viewed as more attractive than skin that does not.
			- Bilateral Symmetry
			- Average Faces: Averaging makes the face more attractive.
	3. Sex Differences in Mate Preferences and Perceived Attractiveness
		- Investment in Offspring
			- Intrasex Competition
			- Intersex Attraction
			- The Evolutionary Explanation for Sex
		- Women & Men rated that intelligence and kindness are more important than physical attractiveness.
		- But, the evolutionary explanation is also right.
		* Men tend to value physical attractiveness as important more than women
		* Men tend to be attracted to women younger than themselves, Women - older
			* Canada: Men on average are attracted to women 1.53 years younger, whereas women are attracted to men 2.72 years older.
		* Women tend to value good financial prospects as more important characteristics in a partner more than men. Japan especially. USA is also up there.
		** Critiques of Evolutionary Theorizing on Sex Differences in Attraction: You could look at these results without referring to evolutionary history; social structure forces females to behave in a certain way.
		- Is attractiveness really universal? Cultural Explanations
			- Body shapes: The ideal body shapes have been changed historically, differ from culture to culture. Nowadays, skinny is in.
	4. Important Conclusions about Physical Attractiveness
		- Though there are some features that are nearly universally-regarded as attractive, there is considerable individual, historical, and cultural variability in what individuals find attractive.
		- Though we tend to like those people who are physically attractive, the reverse is also true; we find people we like more attractive than those we don't like. E.g. happy couples tend to idolize each other's physical attractiveness.
		- Physical attractiveness is less stable than we think; some less attractive young people get better looking with age, and some great looking young people lose their 'luster' with age. Some people are attractive throughout their lives.

"Gibbons mate with gibbons. Deer mingle with deer. Mudsuckers carouse with mudsuckers. Humans consider Mao Ch'iang and Li Chi the most beautiful women. But if fish saw them, they'd head for deep water. If birds saw them, they'd scatter into azure depths. If deer saw them, they'd go bounding away. So of these four, which knows the truth about beauty for all beneath the heaven?"
