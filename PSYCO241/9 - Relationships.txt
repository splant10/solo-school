Characterizing Relationships
    Interpersonal relationships:
        attachments in which bonds of family or friendship or love or respect or hierarchy tie together two or more individuals over an extended period of time.
        Harlow's Research of attachment in Rhesus Monkeys

The Importance of Relationships:
================================
1. The need to belong ***
    5 criteria that determine whether we have a need to belong (Baumeister & Leary, 1995)
    a. Evolutionary basis for our most important relationships: Maximizing the increase likelihoods of one's reproduction
    b. Should be universal
    c. Should guide social cognition
    d. Should be satiable. Satisfying your need to belong.
    e. If the need is chronically unmet, the person should suffer from profound negative consequences.
2. Relationships and the sense of self ***
    Relational self theory:
        examines how prior relationships shape our current beliefs, feelings, and interactions vis-a-vis people who remind us of significant other from our past (It is similar to Freudian school's Object-Relation Theory)
    Relational Self:
        The beliefs, feelings, and expectations about or selves that derive from our relationships with significant others in our lives.
3. Relationships and social Cognition
    a. Relationships as organizing Categories:
        - Relationships organize our memory of social information. They help us to process, store, and recall pieces of information in our daily life.
        - e.g. Participants were more likely to recall the information about the married partners in cluster.  (Constantine Sedikides)
    b. Construing close others as we construe ourselves:
        self-expansion account of relationships:
            a theory that hold that people enter into and remain in close relationships to expand the self by including resources, perspectives, experiences, and characteristic of the other as part of their own self concept
    c. Sharing social construals with close others
        Transactive memory:
            tendency for people in relationships to share information processing of events ... **___** ...
4. Relationships and affective life
    - Experience sampling studies:
        - studies in which researchers provide participants with beepers and randomly signal them throughout the day so that the participants will provide information about what they are doing and how they are feeling at the precise moment.
    - Lonely People report more anxiety and depression.

The Origins of How We Relate to Others:
=======================================
1. Attachment theory
    Theory about how our early attachments with our parents shape our relationships for the remainder of our lives.
    Strange Situation Test:
        - An experimental situation to assess attachment to caregivers in which an infant is observed after her care ...
    Assessing Attachment: Ainsworth's strange situation:
        - devised by Mary Ainsworth
        - a series of events involving the infant's mother and a stranger
        - ***
2. Attachment Styles
    - Secure attachment style:
        + feelings of security in relationships; these persons are comfortable with intimacy and desire to be close to others during times of threat and uncertainty
    - Avoidant attachment style
        + feelings of insecurity in relationships; these persons are prone to exhibit compulsive self-reliance, prefer distance from others, and during conditions of threat and uncertainty are dismissive and detached
    - Anxious attachment style
        + Feelings of insecurity in relationships; these persons compuslively seek closeness, express continual worries about relationships, and during situations of threat and uncertainty, excessively try to get closer to others.
3. Cultural Differences in Attachment Style ***
    Many German children show avoidant attachment styles. Many Israeli and Japanese children show anxious attachment styles. Are they unhealthy children?

Cultural Variations in Attachment Styles ***
    - Sharing night time with others (co-sleeping):
        - European decent middle-class North Americans, infants sleep by themselves in their own bedroom.
        - But, Japanese think that leaving their infants alone at night is regarded as a form of child abuse.
        - As a default, Japanese kids always stay with their caregivers.
        - The very first experiences of infant-caregiver relationships may be the foundation of cultural variations in interpersonal relationships.

Romantic Relationships:
    Triangular Theory of Love:
        There are 3 major components of love - intimacy, passion, and commitment, which can be combined in different ways.

            * Men are more prone to expressing contempt of their partner or ex partner, practically twice as much as women.
        c. Dangerous Attributions
    2. Creating Stronger Romantic Bonds
        a. The Investment  Model of Interpersonal Relationship:
            Three things make partners more committed to one another: rewards, alternatives, and investments in the relationship.
        b. Illusions and Idealization in Romantic Relationships
        c. Novel and Arousing Activities
    3. Cultural Variations in Marital Relationships.
        Mate selection Practice among Preindustrial Societies (Broude & Green, 1983):

    Arranged Marriage:
        Will you only end up loving those people whom you have chosen for yourself?
        Is love ultimately an individualistic choice?
        Is a marriage without love at the foundation bound to be miserable?
        Well turns out from a study on marriage types in India, over time, arranged marriages increased in partner happiness, whereas chosen marriages deteriorated on average.
    Taka says to not disregard the value of arranged marriage!

Summary:
There is a biologically based need to belong. Evolutionary theories point out the benefits of relationships.
Bowlby's attachment theory suggests that the very first experiences of interpersonal relationships are the most important.
There are varieties of interpersonal relationship patterns.
Even the romantic relationship is not monolithic.
