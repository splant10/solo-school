10 (TEENNNNN!) questions on final are from this lecture material.

We are not perceiving social phenomena as they are. we actively evaluate ourselves

2 major distal factors: evolution, and culture

Proximal Distal Influences in Social Psychology
	Proximal - Factors that exits in the her-and-now or that immediately precede what the individual does
	Distal - factors that are more removed in time from a given context or episode
	in recent years, two distal factors have greatly influenced the field of soc psych

	Evolutionary Psychologist attempt to explain commonalities in human behaviour as due to adaptation.

	Evolution and Human Behaviour
		Darwin assume that natural selection is just as important for behavioural propensities as they are for biological characteristics.
		Evolutionary Foundation of Cognition, Aggression, Emotion, Language Ability, and Mating Strategy.
		Identifying:
			1. Genetic Bases of Behaviour
			2. Human Universals
			3. Survival Values of Behaviour
			REmember researchers names from this lecture material
		Cultural Universals
			Cosmide & Tooby
				Every species has a universal, species-typical evolved architecture
				... These evolved psychological [..]
				From their point of view, cultural differences in psychological processes are largely superficial
					they want to investigate human cognition which is supposed to be universal. 
		Culture and Human Behaviour
			cultural psycholgy: research field that invetgates mutual relationships between cuture and the human psyche - Richard Shweder
				- we cannot 
			Jerome Bruner maintains our behaviour is not just a reflection of stimuli. We react based on our interpretations, which are influenced by culture.
			Cultural Psychology
				Cultural Variation in 
				1. Self Concept
				2. Cognition
				3.Emotion
				4.Motivation
				5.Perception
				Identifying socio-cultural Foundations of Human Behaviour
				Steve Heine comparess East asians to NA people 

				Outside of NA, many people holed independent self-construals

				Concept of culture is similar to the cane in Gregory Baleson's stuff. Culture acts as an interface to interpret the world.

			Cultural Perspective on Human Psychological Processes
				"People in Culture A must be different from people in Culture B"

		Culture and Evolution
			Co-evolution of culture and the mind
			Symbolic understanding of the world
			Evolutionary approaches of human socio-cultureal institutions.

			Because of culture, brain size increased.
			Good at digesting cooked food, but cultures cook food differently

			Culturally-shaped brain and body evolved, and makes us extremely unique as a species.

	Applying Social Psychology to Real World
		Healthy - How to reduce one's stress
			-Psychological Stress: the sense that your challenges and demands surpass your current capacities, resources, and energies.
			-Students tend to catch colds towards end of semester because of stress
			Hypthalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis
			-Cortisol
			-Both physical processes have survival values.
			-But, experiencing chronic stress negatively affects our health
			Who feel stress more than others?
				-People in lower-social economic stataus
					high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, repiratory illness, and poor metabolic functioning related to blood glucose levels.
					stomach upset and headaches, and bad backs.
				-People in a subordinate status
					-always need to accomodate to the situation
					-even subordinate baboons feel more stress
				-People who do not have a good social network - Social Support
					-we are a social species
				-People who are pessimistic
					-to avoid a negative cycle, a stress mitigation program is necessary.
		Wealthy - How to make the right decisions
			- Loss Aversion: the tendency for a loss of a given magnitude to have more psychological impact than an equivalent gain.
				Imagine you have 1000 shares of stocks in Corp. X. $25->originally invested $25000, but now goes up to $50000
				1000 shares of stocks in Corp. 1. $75->originally invested $75000, but now goes down to $50000
				Now you have to make a $25000 payment to sell either one of the shares of stocks. People are more likely to sell the stocks that are increasing. Want to avoid feeling like we've sustained a loss.
			- Sunk Cost Fallacy
				People are reluctant to "waste" moeny. This leads people to cnontinue with an endeavour, whether it serves heir future interests or not, because the y have already invested money.
					- You have purchased a concert ticket in advance, but you are later aware that you have an exam the next day.
					- Investments which do not generate any profits
					- Research which is not going well
		Loss Aversion and Framing
			- Mental Accounting: The tendency to treat money differently, depending on how it was acquired and to what mental category it is attached.
				- Participants received a %40 check as a "rebate" or as a "bonus"
				- Those who received their moeny as a rebate spent substantially less than those who received their money as a bonus.
		Wise - How to be successful at school
			Carol Dweck assters that 
			Incrementalist Theory of Intelligence:	
				This belief that intelligence is something you get by working hard.
			Entity Theory of intelligence
				The belief that intelligence is something you're born with and can't change.
			Culture and Achievement:	
				- Asian-American students outperform in many academic disciplines compared to students from other ethnic backgrounds.
				- it is not genetic
				- it is because they hold and incremental theory.
			Can we apply these findings to other ethnic groups?
				- Low income hispanic students will generally improve their grades when they see that external factors (incremental theory) can affect grades, they will work harder
				- When minority groups are shown their grades are in their control, they do better

				- Having an Incremental Theory
				- Thinking of Most Important Values
				- Feelings a sense of primary control

				- Teacher's expectation:
					Pygmalion Effect: the phenomenon in which the greater the expectation placed upon people, often children or students and employees, the better they perform.
				-Social acceptance.
			Statistics, social science, methodology, and critical thinking...
				... especially in social psychology (e.g. ignorance of base-rate information, sunk cost fallacy), which makes people more likely to spot errors in reported scientific studies and more likely to avoid errors of judgment in their own lives.
