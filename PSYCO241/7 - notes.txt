Resistance to Persusion
	Attentional Biases and Resistance
		-Ziva Kunda
		-Caffeine consumption in females is associated with an increased risk of fibrocystic disease
		-Men and women of both low and high caffeine consumer groups were told this. Men had no difference in being convinced by the artical if they were high or low. Women, however, were more likely to believe the artical if they were LOW caffeiene consumers, while less likely to believe the article if they consumed a lot of caffiene.
	Previous Commitments and Resistance
		-Abraham Tesser
		-Public commitment increases our resistance to persuasion
			1. it is hard to back down from a public commitment
			2. public commitment forces us to have a more extreme opinion
		-Thought Polarization hypothesis:
			the hypothesis that more extended thought about a particular issue tends to produce more extreme, entrenched attitudes.
	Knowledge and Resistance
		People with a great deal of knowledge are more resistant to persuasion
	Attitude Inoculation
		Small attacks upon our belifs that engage our attitudes, prior commitments, and knowledge structures, enabling us to counteract a subsequent larger attack and be resistant to persuasion
		-Attitude innoculation experiments:
			"it's a good idea to brush your teeth after every meal if possible"
			"Presitgious authorities were said to have discovered that too much tooth-brushing can damage one's gums"
			Condition 1: (prior to attack)			Support of Truism: 12.5
			Condition 2: (no attack)				6.5
			Condition 3: (innoculation defense)		10.2
			Condition 4: (supportive defense)		7.8
