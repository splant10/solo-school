Evolutionary Aspects of the self 


	---
	Evolution of sense of self?
		- movement from forest to savannah
		- creation of a hunter culture
		- The devolpments of cognitive processes (symbols and language) to acquire food and
		protect from predators
		- Adaptive values of forming a group
		- because of these pressures, sense of self was made

	Why do humans have large brains?
	Social Brain Hypothesis:
		Primate brain evolutionappears to be largely driven by their highly social lifestyle
		(e.g. living with more than 150 individuals)
