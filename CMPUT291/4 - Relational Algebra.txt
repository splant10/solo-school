Cartesian Product is frequently used with some restriction. Even still, try not to use cartesian product in databases, since it is computationally expensive.

Cartesian Product makes huge tables. Say you have a table with 3 columns and 100 rows. Cartesian product of that table * itself will create a table with 3*2 = 6 columns, but will have 100^2 = 10000 rows.

to retrieve information from one table to another, you have to use Cartesian product.
Likely have to use cartesian product in every question on the assignment.
