Design Choices
	Descriptive attributes vs. a new logic entity set
		- some simple facts may be represented by a few descriptive attributes
		- a new entity may be needed for more complicated ones
	Entity set vs. Relationship set
	Binary vs. Ternary Relationships

Representing ER model using tables:
	you need 1 table for 1 entity set,
	3 for 3,
	n for n, etc.
	For each table, each column represents attribute
	1 table for 1 relationship set
	**Exceptions: 1:N relationships can be omitted. Add the key attributes to the N side**
