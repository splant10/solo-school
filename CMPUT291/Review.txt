E-R Model
	-A Logical tool for database design
	- Entity
		- distinguished objects
	-Relationships
		-associations among entities
	-ER Diagrams
	- Mapping constraints
		-one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
	-Keys
		-candidate keys
		-primary keys
	-Reduce and ER diagram to tables
		-one table for one entity set
		-one table for one relationships set
		-reduce tables if possible

	There will be two questions: construct a ER model, and create a series of SQL statements to make tables

Relational Data Model
	-relational algebra
		- Five fundamental operators.
	-Basic idea
		-a seto of tables
	-Database scheme
		-a set of relation schemes
		- a relation scheme is a set of attributes
	-Database design
		-from an ER model to a set of tables
	-Formal Query Languages
		-relational algebra    pi, sigma, x, union, -, intersection, x, /
