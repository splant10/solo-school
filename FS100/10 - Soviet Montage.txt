What is montage?
A synonym for editing
An approach to editing developed by the Soviet filmmakers of the 1920's; it emphasizes dynamic, often discontinuous relationships between shots and the juxtaposition of images to create ideas not present in either shot by itself.

Following the russian revolution, there aren't a lot of resources, so there isn't as much film, so they try a lot of experimenting.
	Tried filming stuff live like a play,
	Take previous films apart and re-edit them together.

Kuleshov
	- took an actor and had that actor with basically one expression (non-descript, placid expression)
	- cut the expression with a bowl of soup, cut to guy, to dead body in coffin, then guy, then naked woman, then guy.
	- hunger -> grief -> lust (meaning is from editing, not from actor's expression)
	- proves the power of editing

Kuleshov Effect:
	a mental phenomenon by which viewers derive more meaning from the interaction of two sequential shots than a single shot in isolation

Creative Geography:
	creating a unified space out of shots made in various widely separated locations (eyeline matches help unify the space)

Don't see these characters put in the space, no establishing shot.

Kuleshov experiment is based on leaving out a scene's establishing shot and leading the spectator to infer spatial or temporal continuity from the shots of separate elements

General Principles of Montage:
	- meaning is constructed not simply shown.
	- Art does not simply represent social reality.
	- Montage dissects and analyses physical reality poetically through strategic framentation and reassembly of images.

Montage editing typically used to:
	- fragment time and space
	- visually embody thematic and intellectual ideas

Techniques of Soviet Montage:
	- Non-diegetic inserts
		- a shot or series of shots cut into a sequence, showing objects represented as being outside the space of the narrative.
		Diegesis is the story world that the film creates.
		Credits aren't seen by characters, BGM isn't heard by characters
		Diegesis:
			In a narractive film, the world of the film's story. The diegesis includes events that are presumed to have occurred and actions and spaces not shown onscreen.
		Non-Diegetic:
			a term used for any narrative sound or visual element not contained in the story world. Also called "extradiegetic".

	- Overlapping editing
		- the second shot repeats part or all of the action from the previous shot
		- expands screen time noticeably
		- makes things more dramatic

	- Elliptical editing
		- A portion of the event is left out, so the even takes less time that it would in reality.
	- Graphic and rhythmic editing
