F-stop:
	how much a camera shutter opens to vary how much light is taken in
	f/2 = full
	f/16 = tiny

Focal Length:
	the distance from the centre of the lens to the point where light rays converge to a point of focus on the film.

Types of lenses:
	wide angle lens (short focal length) 
		makes subjects appear farther apart than they actually are
	normal lens (middle focal length)
		produces images that correspond to our day-to-day experience of depth and perspective
		keeps all subject sin a normal sense of focus
	telephoto lens (long focal length)
		brings distant objects close
		flattens space and depth
		can leave most of the background and foreground out of focus
	zoom lens (variable focal length)
		produces images that simulate the effect of camera movement toward or away from the subject

Zoom in:
	the act of changes the lens' focal length to narrow the field of a distant object, magnifying and reframing it,
	often in close-up, while the camera remains stationary.

Film Gauge:
	the width of the film stock

Aspect Ratio:
	the relationship of the frame's width to its height

Widescreen Technologies:
	Cinerama
		Curved 180 degree screens - needed 3 seperate projectors
		Need to make sure each of the cameras stayed in sync
	Cinemascope
	Vistavision

Xavier Dolan - Mommy (2014)
	used a 1:1 aspect ratio
	shifted to a wider aspect ratio partway through film to critical acclaim

Pan and Scan:
	the process used to transfer a widescreen-format film to the standard television aspect ratio
	bad

Depth of Field:
	the range of distances before the lens within which objects can be photographed in sharp focus.
	Shallow DoF:
		small amount of focus
