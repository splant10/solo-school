Film Noir and the Hard-Boiled Detective Film
	p 382-393 in Text
	This film style sort of just happened. The term "film noir" was applied retroactively to these films after 1945 once they were released in Europe.
	Film Noir is less a genre than a group of films with a stylistic and narrative tendency.
	1946 was a really big year for film noir

	Characteristics of Film Noir Style
		Many of the films use distinctive high and low angle,
		Low-key lighting to create distinct areas of light and dark,
		Image was the high contrast image,
		extreme wide angle lenses,
		location shooting,
		majority of the scenes lit for night,
		rain drenched streets,
		convoluted narrative,
		a fondness for oblique lines and fractured light.

	Femme Fatale:
		a sexually provocative and dangerous woman willing to lie and use her sexual advances to trap the protagonist in a web of deceit.
		Ususally have dark hair (blonde means angelic)
		They smoke, or drank, obviously quite seductive in their appearance.
