    Sound Hierarchy
        The relative priority given to dialogue, effects, music in a given scene
        In most cases, dialogue is considered most important of these sounds and rests atop of the sound hierarchy

    Dialogue Overlap
        In editing a scene, arranging the cut so that a bit of dialogue coming from Shot A is heard under a shot which shows another character or another element in the scene.

    Overlapping Dialogue
        Mixing two or more characters speech to imitate the rhythm of speech.

    Diegetic Sound

    Non Diegetic Sound
        Sound such as mood music, or a director's commentary, represented as coming from a source outside the space of the narrative.
    Semi-diegetic sound
        Sound that is neither strictly diegetic or non-diegetic

    Sound Perspective:
        The apparent location and distance of a sound source.

    Aural POV
        Subjective sound from the perspective of the character

    On screen sound:
        Sound that derives from an on-screen source such as someone viewers see and hear sneezing

    Off screen sound:
        Sound that does not derive from an onscren source, such as an unseen dog barking or music that is not made by anyone within frame.
