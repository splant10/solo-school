Usability Testing:
	Need to do testing to make sure we reached our specification, as well point out flaws with the design.

Heuristic Method:
	Evaluation:
		based on heuristcs distilled from an empirical analysis of 249 usability problems
		These have been revised for current tech
		Design guidlines form a basis for evaluation

	Nielsen split heuristics into 10 categories:
		- visibility of system status
		- match between system and the real world
		- user control and freedom
		- consistency and standards
		- help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
		- error prevention
		- recognition rather than recall
		- flexibility and efficiency of use
		- aesthetic and minimalist design
		- help and documentation

	Three stages:
		briefing session
			tell experts what to do
		evaluation period (1 to 2 hours)
			each expert works separately
			take on pass to get a feel for the product
			take a second pass to foxus on specific features
		debreifing session
			experts work together and prioritize problems

		Then fill out a heuristic evaluation form
