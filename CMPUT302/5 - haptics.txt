Haptic perception
    Mechanoreceptors on the skin
        Cells - ends of neurons that allow actual perception
        Meissner's corpuscule - small receptive field size, fast adaptation
        Pacinian corpuscule - large receptive field size, fast adaptation
        Merkel's disk - small receptive field size, slow adaptation
        Ruffini's ending - large receptive field size, slow adaptation

Proprioception (Kinesthesia)
    muscle length and tension   
    joint position.
    Perception of limb movement and position, force
    Muscle receptors (muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs)
        Golgi tendon organs:    
            provide information about changes in muscle tension. Force sensing.
        Muscle Spindles:
            provide information about hcanges in muscle length. Position sensing.
    Joint receptors (in capsules and ligaments of joints)
    skin receptors (slowly adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors that measure skin stretch)
    Rufini endings, Merkel Cells in hairy skin, and field receptors

    Dorsal Column - medical lemniscal system
        Provides information about tactile sensation and limb proprioception

    Spinothalamic pathway
        provides information [...]
